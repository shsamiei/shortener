# URL Shortener

### what is URL shortener? 
A URL shortener is a tool that creates a custom link that will send traffic to any website you choose only with significantly 
fewer characters than a traditional URL. URL shorteners work by redirecting the traffic. When you input a URL into a URL shortener, 
it creates a shorter link that, when clicked on, redirects the user to the original URL. So, instead of going directly to your website
by entering a lengthy URL into your web browser, clicking the shortened link will redirect the end-user to the website/desired assetâ€”bypassing
the need for the full URL.
